An insecure guest logon occurs when a server logs the user on as an unauthenticated guest, typically in response to an authentication failure. Guest logons do not support standard security features such as signing and encryption. As a result, allowing guest logons makes the client vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that can expose sensitive data on the network. Windows disables insecure guest logons by default. Microsoft does not recommend enabling insecure guest logons.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

4,1,1635321799,DESKTOP-AUKB810,Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient[4]:, The AllowInsecureGuestAuth registry value is not configured with default settings.    Default Registry Value:  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters]  "AllowInsecureGuestAuth"=dword:0  Configured Registry Value:  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters]  "AllowInsecureGuestAuth"=dword:1    Guidance:  This event indicates that an administrator has enabled insecure guest logons. An insecure guest logon occurs when a server logs the user on as an unauthenticated guest, typically in response to an authentication failure. Guest logons do not support standard security features such as signing and encryption. As a result, allowing guest logons makes the client vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that can expose sensitive data on the network. Windows disables insecure guest logons by default. Microsoft does not recommend enabling insecure guest logons.#015

An insecure guest logon occurs when a server logs the user on as an unauthenticated guest, typically in response to an authentication failure. Guest logons do not support standard security features such as signing and encryption. As a result, allowing guest logons makes the client vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that can expose sensitive data on the network. Windows disables insecure guest logons by default. Microsoft does not recommend enabling insecure guest logons.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key.

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015

It is generated on the computer that was accessed.    The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.    The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).    The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.    The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.    The impersonation level field indicates the extent to which a process in the logon session can impersonate.    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.  #011- Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.  #011- Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.  #011- Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.  #011- Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.#015
